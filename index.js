// Highest word count (45 mins)

// Write a function that given a string returns an array containing
// the most frequent word in it. If the top frequency is shared by more than
// one word, the array will contain all of them (the order is not relevant).
// Your implementation should exclude anything that is not a word
// (e.g. punctuation and numbers), and use lodash methods where possible.
// If the input is an empty string, return an empty array.
// If the input is not a string, an error should be thrown.
// TIP: You'll need to use a regex.
